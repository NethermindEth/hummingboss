# HummingBoss

A Rust-based LLM trading agent that optimizes Hummingbot parameters through continuous learning and adaptation.

## Core Concept

HummingBoss augments Hummingbot's trading capabilities by using an LLM to:
- Monitor trading performance
- Analyze market conditions
- Adjust parameters hourly
- Learn from historical decisions through persistent memory

## Technical Architecture

### Components
- Hummingbot Core: Trading execution
- LLM Agent: Parameter optimization
- Memory Store: Decision history
- Performance Analytics: Results tracking

### Data Flow
1. Execute trades with current parameters
2. Collect hourly metrics
3. LLM analyzes performance
4. Generate and apply new parameters
5. Store results and reasoning

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Rust-based Hummingbot connector
- [ ] LLM parameter adjustment
- [ ] Performance tracking

### Phase 2: Intelligence
- [ ] Persistent memory
- [ ] Decision logging
- [ ] Analysis tools

### Phase 3: Scale
- [ ] Multi-market support
- [ ] Risk management
- [ ] Community integration

## Contributing

Seeking collaborators for:
- Rust implementation
- LLM prompt engineering
- Trading strategies
- Performance optimization

## Risks

- LLM decisions may be suboptimal
- Market volatility impact
- Test with small amounts only
- No profit guarantees
